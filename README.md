### Congressional Influence Model

This is a collection of data and code for investigating influence in Congress. Specifically, it uses data generated by [MapLight](http://maplight.org/) and the [Center for Responsive Politics](http://www.opensecrets.org/) to identify opposing interest groups and analyze their political contributions.

Unfortunately, due to size constraints, not all of the campaign finance data can be included in this repo. But if you’re curious you can download it using [this scraper](https://github.com/WestleyArgentum/maplight-scraper) (see further instructions there).

#### How to run

1) Copy the contribution `.csv` files scraped from MapLight into `./113th-contributions`
2) Launch a [Julia](http://julialang.org/) REPL.
3) `julia> require(“./opposing-groups.jl”)`
