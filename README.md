### Congressional Influence Model

This is a collection of data and code for investigating influence in Congress. Specifically, it uses data generated by [MapLight]() and the [Center for Responsive Politics]() to identify opposing interest groups and analyze their political contributions.

Unfortunately, due to size constraints, not all of the campaign finance data can be included in this repo. But if youâ€™re curious you can download it using [this scraper](https://github.com/WestleyArgentum/maplight-scraper) (see further instructions there).
